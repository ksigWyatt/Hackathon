# Hertz Hackathon 2017
This repo is what was left of my code from the greak hackening of 2017. 

*Legend tells of a man, attempting to create an Augmented Reality app for iOS wrote almost 3,000 lines of code in a single day, alone. At the end of this exausting day and after much strife, he committed his code and all was well. Soon after hea realized it was not so, for he committed only to a local repo. When evening came he removed his code, to set forth in his journey. Aye, but the deed was already done... his work did in fact go.* 

### Project Legacy
This is all that is left of the AR App that I was making. If I can still find any screenshots, I will add them here.
