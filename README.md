# Hertz Hackathon 2017
This repo is what was left of my code from the great hackening of 2017. 

*Legend tells of a man, attempting to create an Augmented Reality app for iOS wrote almost 3,000 lines of code in a single day, alone. At the end of this exausting day and after much strife, he committed his code and all was well. Soon after - he realized it was not so, for he committed only to a local repo. When evening came he removed his code, to set forth in his journey. Aye, but the deed was already done... his work did in fact go.* 

### Project Legacy
This is all that is left of the AR App that I was making. If I can still find any screenshots, I will add them here.
